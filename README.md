## Square Wave
Demonstrating summing sines to create a square wave

### Playing with sums of sines
Square Wave demonstrates how summing sines of various frequencies and amplitudes can produce a square wave.
By pressing left and right, you can add or remove circles. The sines are represented by the combined amplitudes.
As more circles are added, the sum approaches a perfect square wave.

For those who don't want to use Processing, a compiled version is avaiable for download. Java is required to run it though.

### Learning from code examples
The programming solution is (relatively) clean and easily understood.
I added generous comments so students should be able to go through and understand the code.
If there is anything confusing or something could be improved on, contact me or send a pull request.
